To see how it's working I was using MAMP.

Setup MAMP. In settings:
Choose nginx WebServer
Port for nginx: 8081
Port for MySQL: 3036
PHP standart version: 5.6.24
Then Upload all files from dir 'test_task_backend' in MAMP/htdocs/your_dir. To see how it's working I type loclalhost:8081/your_dir/ in adress bar of Google Chrome Browser. Then you will find out.

# 'test_task_frontend' make HTML/CSS page from pictures Frontend_info/page.jpg and Frontend_info/page2.jpg

To see how it's looking just put files from 'test_task_frontend' somewhere together and then double click test_task_frontend.html to open it in Browser
